In addition, absence of a robust workflow automation or version control which means that any discrepancies need to be traced, root-cause is to be analyzed and resolved.

Built-in checks, rule-based exceptions reporting allows your Finance team to have the flexibility of repeating certain tasks regularly or on demand while also automatically marking where accountants and controllers need to direct their efforts to handle exceptions. This eliminates the need for intervening in a much larger set of transaction data and narrows down manual efforts in handling exceptions only.
