Further, to improve the responsiveness of the Platform, as you navigate through a website, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, such as Internet Protocol addresses, cookies, Internet tags, and navigational data collection.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Website may use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP Address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user’s computer). We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to our site, and administer and improve the site.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A “</span><b>cookie</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” is a bit of information that a website sends to your web browser that helps the site remember information about you and your preferences. You can set your browser to reject cookies, however not all aspects of the site may be available to you if you choose to do so.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><b>Session</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” cookies are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your Web browser window or otherwise turn your computer off.

This site uses session cookies.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><b>Persistent</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information on your computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (e.g., passwords), helping to determine what areas of the website visitors find most valuable, and customizing the website based on your preferences.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><b>Internet tags</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” (also known as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies and tell the website server information such as the IP address and browser type related to the visitor’s computer. This site uses Internet tags. Tags have been placed both on online advertisements that bring people to the site and on different pages of the site. These tags indicate how many times a page is opened and which information is consulted. We do not collect or seek personally identifiable information through these tags.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><b>Navigational data</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” (“log files,” “server logs,” and “clickstream” data) are used for system management, to improve the content of the site, market research purposes, and to communicate information to visitors.
