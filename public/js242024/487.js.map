Accountants spend the bulk of their time reviewing and making adjustment entries making sure every exception is resolved before posting to accountancy.\n                However, without the help of automation in the process, month-end closing can be extremely time-consuming, cumbersome and complex. This can lead to delays in financial reporting and decision-making.  The lack of a single source for data, makes it difficult to ensure accuracy. In addition, absence of a robust workflow automation or version control which means that any discrepancies need to be traced, root-cause is to be analyzed and resolved. Traditional tools significantly hinder the process due to inability to handle data from various sources, running rule-based checks for large data sets and so on.\n                `,\n                benefit: `The process typically includes four steps which include identifying where data comes from; making sure there isn't any overlap between transactions across these various ledgers before finally reconciling them all at once after and then ensuring that the financial reports are accurately representing business performance.\n                Analytical automation and Custom Reconciliation Solutions can help you overcome these challenges by automating the reconciliation process starting with bringing the data from various sources to a single platform, reconcile differences between General Ledger and sub-ledgers, external sources like Bank transactions and Foreign exchange rates, and Internal Information such as Inter-company transactions.\n                Designing and developing workflow automation is a great way to streamline your month-end processes. Built-in checks, rule-based exceptions reporting allows your Finance team to have the flexibility of repeating certain tasks regularly or on demand while also automatically marking where accountants and controllers need to direct their efforts to handle exceptions. This eliminates the need for intervening in a much larger set of transaction data and narrows down manual efforts in handling exceptions only. Reduction in manual efforts directly impacts your ROI and drives greater efficiency into the process.`},\n\n            ],\n            singleCard:{}\n        }\n    },\n\n    methods: {\n        display(card){\n            this.singleCard = card\n            this.isHidden = true;\n\n        //    this.cardTitle.forEach((value,index) => {\n        //        this.singleCard.push(value);\n        //        console.log(value)\n        //        console.log(index)\n        //    });\n        },\n        hidden(){\n            return this.isHidden = false\n        }\n    },\n\n}\n</script>\n<style>\n\n</style>\n","import { render } from \"./ServiceThree.vue?vue&type=template&id=6a28ad65&lang=true\"\nimport script from \"./ServiceThree.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./ServiceThree.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"C:\\\\Users\\\\Ismail\\\\Desktop\\\\valuexpa\\\\node_modules\\\\vue-loader\\\\dist\\\\exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__","<template lang=\"html\">\n\n    <div>\n        <ContactFooter/>\n        <div class=\"container-fluid contact-footer-2\">\n            <div class=\"container py-5 my-4\">\n                <div class=\"row justify-content-evenly\">\n                    <div class=\"col-lg-5 text-light\">\n                        <p><b>About Us</b></p>\n                        <i> ValueXPA is a Global technology-enabled Finance-as-a-Service Partner for Small and Mid-sized\n                            Businesses and Institutions.
